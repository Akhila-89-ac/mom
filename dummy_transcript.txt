SPEAKER_03: So errors are reduced and chances of reaching accuracy is high. , start_time = 48.954 , end time = 52.819
SPEAKER_02:  Yes, I agree with you, but isn't this AI making the humans so lazy with its applications? , start_time = 54.368 , end time = 59.816
SPEAKER_02: Like most of its applications are automated, majority of its work is being automated. , start_time = 59.916 , end time = 64.884
SPEAKER_02: So like if humans get addicted to this type of inventions, this might cause a lot of problems to the future generations, like they might become so lazy. , start_time = 64.904 , end time = 73.677
SPEAKER_04:  When it's not making people lazy, instead people will be still working on their creativity part. , start_time = 76.171 , end time = 80.677
SPEAKER_04: Like for the decisions where they have to think and make something, people will be working on that. , start_time = 80.757 , end time = 84.742
SPEAKER_04: Whereas for the jobs which are repetitive like sending mails and making documents and in the documents where the error should be reduced. , start_time = 84.762 , end time = 90.91
SPEAKER_04: For those particular things, the robots or the AI machines will be working. , start_time = 90.93 , end time = 93.953
SPEAKER_04: This will reduce people from working on their boring parts and instead use their mind and energy on the creative parts. , start_time = 94.614 , end time = 100.862
SPEAKER_01:  I think for the repetitive jobs and the boring jobs you are talking about, I don't think there is any reason to have robots which are made of higher cost and also it requires maintenance of these robots. , start_time = 103.07 , end time = 116.113
SPEAKER_01: So for these repetitive jobs, I don't think you need to put this much price and you need to get a robot to do these silly jobs. , start_time = 116.453 , end time = 124.107
SPEAKER_03: Yes, I agree, but it's a one-time investment. , start_time = 125.229 , end time = 127.693
SPEAKER_03:  So this is considered because artificial intelligence is available for humans, customers or anyone like for more than 24 hours, like for 24x7. , start_time = 128.011 , end time = 140.792
SPEAKER_02: Yes, only it is available 24x7. , start_time = 142.756 , end time = 144.579
SPEAKER_02: But isn't this availability making a cause of unemployment? , start_time = 145.36 , end time = 149.407
SPEAKER_02: Like if this AI is replacing the majority of these repeated tasks, , start_time = 149.427 , end time = 153.073
SPEAKER_02:  So this might cause a lot of unemployment. , start_time = 153.408 , end time = 155.554
SPEAKER_02: Like every organization is looking to replace the minimum qualified individuals with the Aero botnets. , start_time = 155.855 , end time = 160.308
SPEAKER_02: This will cause a lot of unemployment in the future. , start_time = 160.568 , end time = 162.574
SPEAKER_04:  This is not going to cause unemployment because the first point is the people are only ones who are making the robots. , start_time = 164.545 , end time = 168.91
SPEAKER_04: So if the unemployment will be causing this sector, it will be created in some other sectors. , start_time = 169.27 , end time = 172.914
SPEAKER_04: The employment will be created in some other sector. , start_time = 172.934 , end time = 174.576
SPEAKER_04: Along with that, for the jobs where the risk is involved, where the human life is at risk, we can make machine to do those tasks like in any fire extinguishing work or in any natural disaster or human disaster. , start_time = 174.996 , end time = 186.889
SPEAKER_04: In those cases instead, if a human will do the work, there is a risk of their lives. , start_time = 187.27 , end time = 192.395
SPEAKER_04: Whereas if a machine works, , start_time = 192.836 , end time = 194.097
SPEAKER_04:  There are chances of more accuracy, more efficiency and the risk is less. , start_time = 194.532 , end time = 199.665
SPEAKER_01:  But what I think is these robots are pre-programmed. , start_time = 202.058 , end time = 205.463
SPEAKER_01: So during these natural disasters that you are talking about, if the robot doesn't really know the solution, like if they cannot really act on spot, like if the new problem arises during these natural disasters, then I don't think there is any robot that can solve, that can think on its own and solve a problem accordingly. , start_time = 205.503 , end time = 229.315
SPEAKER_03:  See, it also helps us with digital assistance. , start_time = 230.408 , end time = 235.697
SPEAKER_03: Educational institutions, helpline centers, hospitals, et cetera, uses digital assistance. , start_time = 236.117 , end time = 241.426
SPEAKER_03: So organizations have a customer support team. , start_time = 241.807 , end time = 245.613
SPEAKER_03: So they work all the time. , start_time = 246.014 , end time = 247.396
SPEAKER_03: And at any time, humans take their help and it's useful. , start_time = 247.496 , end time = 251.623
SPEAKER_02:  Yes, it is available in digital assistance. , start_time = 253.038 , end time = 255.442
SPEAKER_02: But this unit has one thing is that machines can't order their responses to changing environments. , start_time = 255.462 , end time = 260.91
SPEAKER_02: So that is the basic premise on which these AIs are built. , start_time = 261.431 , end time = 264.416
SPEAKER_02: So this repetitive nature of work where the input doesn't change. , start_time = 264.836 , end time = 267.941
SPEAKER_02: So machines can't get what is right, what is wrong, or they're not capable of what is legal or illegal, that kind of things. , start_time = 268.562 , end time = 275.012
SPEAKER_04:  For the new task, we still have humans to work for those kind of things. , start_time = 276.528 , end time = 280.115
SPEAKER_04: But for the tasks which are predefined, we can tell the machine that this is right and this is wrong. , start_time = 280.135 , end time = 284.102
SPEAKER_04: For those particular tasks, the decision-making by the robots will be faster and will be more efficient. , start_time = 284.462 , end time = 288.931
SPEAKER_04: The error will be less in those decisions and they'll be faster. , start_time = 289.472 , end time = 291.776
SPEAKER_04: So this will reduce human effort. , start_time = 291.816 , end time = 293.218
SPEAKER_04: Along with that, it will increase the efficiency of the particular task. , start_time = 293.559 , end time = 296.865
SPEAKER_01:  But I think even in the past, like the old tasks which you were talking about, there needs to be improvements, right? , start_time = 298.685 , end time = 306.796
SPEAKER_01: Like the world is changing and it has to be updating like every day. , start_time = 307.117 , end time = 311.423
SPEAKER_01: So I don't think the robots will be able to update themselves. , start_time = 311.763 , end time = 314.347
SPEAKER_01: And again, the human involvement has to be there to update the robots. , start_time = 314.487 , end time = 317.912
SPEAKER_01: So I think it's time-taking and also it's very much cost-effective. , start_time = 318.272 , end time = 324.421
SPEAKER_01: It's not cost-effective. , start_time = 324.441 , end time = 326.143
SPEAKER_00:  Thank you guys, those were some nice points. , start_time = 330.562 , end time = 332.246
SPEAKER_00: As we have seen, these are some advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence. , start_time = 332.968 , end time = 338.04
SPEAKER_00: As we know, every new invention or breakthrough will have both advantages and disadvantages. , start_time = 338.741 , end time = 343.012
SPEAKER_00: It is upon us how we use it. , start_time = 343.513 , end time = 345.357
SPEAKER_00: So when we use the artificial intelligence to its limit, we all could really enjoy the outcomes of it. , start_time = 346.219 , end time = 352.614
SPEAKER_00: Thank you. , start_time = 353.196 , end time = 353.717
